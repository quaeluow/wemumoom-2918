BEGIN_TEXT
The service time in queues should not have a large variance; otherwise, the queue tends to build up. A bank regularly checks service time by its tellers to determine its variance. A random sample of $sts[$i1] service times (in minutes) gives \(s^{2}=$squ[$i1]\). Give a $cnf[$i1]% confidence interval for the variance of service time at the bank.
$PAR
The lower bound is approximately \{ ans_rule(7) \} minutes (round to three digits after the decimal point).$BR
The upper bound is approximately \{ ans_rule(7) \} minutes (round to three digits after the decimal point).
